# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Vishal Kaleria

I'm a self-taught full-stack developer, born on April 10, 2007.

I build things on my own â€” quietly, patiently, and with purpose.  
I donâ€™t have much, but I have curiosity, persistence, and code.

I'm an introvert who loves to create.  
I believe in simple tools, clean code, and sharing what I learn.

### ðŸ›  What I do

- Build web and desktop apps  
- Work with TypeScript, Node.js, and FFmpeg  
- Create useful open-source tools  
- Learn something new every day  

---

### âœ¨ Why I build

To learn.  
To grow.  
To help someone like me â€” starting from zero.

Thanks for visiting my profile.  
I'm just getting started. ðŸš€
