# Vishal Kaleria

Self-taught full-stack developer.  
Born April 10, 2007.  
I work alone — quiet, focused, and consistent.  

I build with **MERN**, **Electron**, and native technologies.  
Love turning ideas into real tools, especially the ones I need myself.  
No roadmap, no team — just me, learning and building every day.

I don’t chase trends. I create what matters to me.

That’s it.
